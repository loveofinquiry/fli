Due to its ability to grow in the pattern of nodes and branches, technologists have been using it as a tool and medium to represent a wide array of efficient systems, from the functionality of the Internet to the mapping of transit systems in various cities. The workshop will cover the wonders of slime mold, exploring its ability to solve puzzles and model behavior for issues of displacement, migration, equitable societies and probe new potentials for artists to navigate and resist borders. Participants will learn how to inoculate, cultivate, and care for their slime mold. Using a SlimeSensor, a small dome-shaped terrarium embedded with the technical ability to communicate via a raspberry pi micro-computer, participants will create a hospitable ecosystem for your slime to flourish."},{"type":"paragraph","value":"The workshop was held by Ayodamola Okunseinde, Ashley Lewis, Ella Hillström and Christoffer Horlitz in collaboration with"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"[SlimeTechLab](http://slimetechlab.org/)"},{"type":"paragraph","value":"."}]},{"item_id":"f63dc1b0-efe1-4b87-a452-e9137694b302","properties":{"cover_image":{"type":"files","value":[]},"website":{"type":"url","value":"https://www.culturehub.org/events/conversation-on-being-apart-being-together"},"date":{"type":"date","value":{"start":"2020-11-20","end":null}},"thumbnail_image":{"type":"files","value":[]},"partners":{"type":"rich_text","value":[]},"location":{"type":"rich_text","value":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Virtual","link":null},"annotations":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"strikethrough":false,"underline":false,"code":false,"color":"default"},"plain_text":"Virtual","href":null}]},"event_type":{"type":"select","single":true,"value":["Panel"]},"tags":{"type":"multi_select","value":[]},"title":{"type":"title","value":"Being apart & together"}},"mdcontent":[{"type":"paragraph","value":"CultureHub hosts a conversation on emergent distributed strategies for community engagement.
