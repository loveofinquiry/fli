            For the Love of Inquiry is an innovative anthropology research laboratory dedicated to pushing the
            boundaries of methods for investigation. We explore research problems through anthropological, archival,
            artistic research methods to foster better practitioners who have a conscious understanding of their role in
            the world and how it affects local and global communities.

                    <p>What can slime mold teach us about issues of migration and displacement?</p>
                    <p>Slime mold is a bright, vivid, living monoculture. Due to its ability to grow in the pattern of
                        nodes
                        and branches, technologists have been using it as a tool and medium to represent a wide array of
                        efficient systems, from the functionality of the Internet to the mapping of transit systems in
                        various cities. The workshop will cover the wonders of slime mold, exploring its ability to
                        solve
                        puzzles and model behavior for issues of displacement, migration, equitable societies and probe
                        new
                        potentials for artists to navigate and resist borders. Participants will learn how to inoculate,
                        cultivate, and care for their slime mold. Using a SlimeSensor, a small dome-shaped terrarium
                        embedded with the technical ability to communicate via a raspberry pi micro-computer,
                        participants
                        will create a hospitable ecosystem for your slime to flourish.</p>

                    <p>In this multidisciplinary course, students will confront the ways new technologies are changing
                        border controls and the regulation of migration. These technologies include automated facial
                        recognition, the usage of other biometric markers, the observing of digital presence and more.
                        Alongside harsher border controls, where artists are under scrutiny and increasingly restricted,
                        an
                        emerging body of artists are responding to the border through activism, performances and
                        installations, as well as shaping collaborations in the digital realm. We will discuss this in
                        response to our current time: COVID-19, BLM, financial crises, student restrictions etc. We
                        believe
                        this class gives students the opportunity to process collectively what they are living through.
                        The
                        class will culminate in students’ own final multimedia project where they, as artists and
                        investigators, respond to notions of digitized borders. Students are expected not only to engage
                        their critical thinking skills with respect to the class topics, but also to design, build, and
                        deploy creative responses.</p>
                    <p>What is the impact of emerging digital borderscapes on the lives, works, and practice of artists?
                        What are the hurdles faced in artistic practice when transgressing the national borderscape? How
                        can
                        artists and investigators respond to the changing face of the nation-state border? These are the
                        main questions that will connect the weeks presented below. Have these questions in mind as you
                        engage with the material.</p>

                    <p>Companies such as Amazon, Google, or Facebook are building infrastructures that make it possible
                        for
                        artists and communities across borders to connect, share work, and similarities. Yet the very
                        same
                        technologies are policing, surveilling, and restricting persons from moving across borders.
                        Disproportionally, this affects Black, Brown, and marginalized communities. This development is
                        emblematic of the increasingly omnipresent surveilling border-technology. In this panel, we
                        explore
                        the role artists have in responding to these emerging technologies. How can artists
                        reappropriate
                        the technologies of the military/police-industrial complex? Can glitching be considered an

                    <p>In a state of ontological crisis, all boundaries between human and machine, nature and culture,
                        and
                        the organic and inorganic have been severely blurred. These are times of curious contrivances,
                        novel
                        natures, inescapable automation, and posthuman performances – where human and nonhuman find
                        themselves being entwined, meshed and muddled into new unwitting entanglements. But from biased
                        machine-learning to surveillance capitalism and digital colonisation – what power-structures are
                        implicitly and covertly being embedded into these technologies?</p>
                    <p>‘POM Berlin – Rogue Research’ aims to probe new methodological approaches from art, design and
                        civic
                        activism within the framework of academia in order to surface an inter- and transdisciplinary
                        terrain that attempts to exceed the boundaries of theory and practice, academia and activism,
                        and
                        science and civil society.</p>

                    <p>With the rise of new digitised technologies at the nation-state border, the border itself has
                        become
                        more difficult to identify, demanding new tools and methods to recognize it and intervene. In
                        this
                        paper, we explore how artists are being impacted by borders but also how they respond, critique
                        and
                        interfere. Artists have long been experimenting, breaching, and revealing the weakness of the
                        border, both in terms of symbolic borders like categorical associations and the nation-state
                        border.
                        Artistic interventions into conventional, physical borders include painting the border
                        invisible,
                        simulating the border, rendering a border permeable via audio technology and designing seesaws
                        with
                        which people on either side of the wall can interact. But how can artists respond to new
                        digitised
                        border technologies? How can they react to a border that is no longer symbolising a
                        “line-in-the-sand,” but a border that is “everywhere”?</p>

                    <p>The research project is under the title “Artists at the Digital Border” and IVC will be the host
                        organization in Lebanon, as we are curating several interviews, round tables, and workshops with
                        several Lebanese artist working in conjunction with international artists to collect testimonies
                        and
                        research data for the intended project to accumulate into writing a manifesto concerning
                        artists’
                        mobility and digital borders. The research group is now conducting semi-public interviews or
                        what we
                        call Salons with artists from several countries around the world, talking about the relationship
                        between the body and the virtual: How the artist’s body encounters borders in the virtual; the
                        use
                        of technology in art vs. physical presence; border crossing and how it affects the artistic
