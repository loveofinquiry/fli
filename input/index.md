For the Love of Inquiry is an innovative anthropology research laboratory dedicated to pushing the boundaries of methods for investigation. We explore research problems through anthropological, archival, artistic research methods to foster better practitioners who have a conscious understanding of their role in the world and how it affects local and global communities.
